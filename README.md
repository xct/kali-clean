# Kali-Clean

My kali i3 desktop setup. Some people have been asking so I wrote a quick installer to get going. 

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh . This installs a lot of stuff, including all nerd-fonts, so it will take a while (about 20 minutes last time I checked). Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).
